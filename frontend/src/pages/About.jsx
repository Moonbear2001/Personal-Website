const blurb = `Growing up as an Air Force kid, I moved all around the world and called places like England, Japan, France, and the United States home. I've lived Alabama, Texas, California. I've lived in nice houses and motorhomes and Iâ€™ve learned that adaptability is key to thriving in any environment.\n\nThis idea has driven me in everything I do, including my journey into computer science. When I started at Rice University, I had never written a single line of code, but I dove in headfirst, striving to improve every day. Over those four years of struggle and growth and love of computers, science, math, and programming was born.\n\nToday, I am committed to continuous improvement, actively learning new languages and technologies to become a versatile and well-rounded professional in the tech industry. I constantly put my skill to the test with tutoring and freelance work.`;
